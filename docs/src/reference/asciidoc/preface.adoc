== Preface
The concept of a state machine is most likely older that any reader
of this reference documentation and definitely older than the Java
language itself. Description of finite automata dates back to 1943
when gentlemen Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts wrote a paper about
it. Later George H. Mealy presented a state machine concept in 1955
which is known as a Mealy Machine. A year later in 1956 Edward F.
Moore presented another paper which is known as a Moore Machine. If
you've ever read anything about state machines, the names Mealy and Moore
should have popped up at some point.
